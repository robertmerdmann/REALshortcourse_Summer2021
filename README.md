## Welcome to the REAL R Short Course!

This is the course page for the Summer 2021 iteration of the REAL R Short Course.  Here, we will share all of the course materials and information in a central location.

### Course Schedule

We will meet synchronously via Zoom on Wednesdays from July 21 through September 8 (for a total of 8 sessions).

Eastern time: 1PM - 2PM

Central time: 12 noon - 1PM

Mountain time: 11AM - 12 noon

Pacific time: 10AM - 11AM

### Day One (July 21, 2021)

First, we will work on [Getting Started](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_GitHub.html), and will walk through computer set-up preliminaries.

Second, we will work through [R, RStudio, and RMarkdown](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_Activity.html), where we'll take our first foray into R.

Together, these two parts will serve as a starting point and foundation for the rest of our work together, and will set us up for discussions of graphing in Days 2 and 3!

### Between Day One and Day Two

Here is the Github location of the [Day 2 Prep Work](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/c81c92a0ee073a3e064e666c572b8fdaa8702c7a/Day2PrepWork/Day2PrepWork.Rmd) - the file you need is named Day2PrepWork.Rmd - this is an RMarkdown document. If you are using Github Desktop and have cloned the class repository (REALshortcourse_Summer2021), you should be able to find this within the new Day2PrepWork folder.  You'll want to open this file in RStudio, and then edit/run code within the document itself.  The document provides the instructions needed as you go.  Have fun, and don't hesitate to reach out if you are running into difficulties! 

### Day Two (July 28, 2021)

Major topic - plotting in R

We will work through the [Day 2 lesson](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day2/Day2_1.html) together - which will cover the importing of data from external files, all the way through using ggplot2 to build scatterplots and barplots.

It is unlikely that we'll get to the [Day 2 activity](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day2/Day2_2activity.html) during our synchronous time, but it is here for your reference even if we don't!

### Between Day Two and Day Three

Here is the Github location of the [Day 2 homework](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/30341e9b9741ad29486029c34a04d47c13a2cbb0/Day2Homework/Day2_hw.Rmd) - the ["Day2Homework"](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/tree/main/Day2Homework) folder contains both this RMarkdown file as well as the .csv file with the necessary data.  Happy plotting!

### Day Three (August 4, 2021)

Major topic - plotting in R, continued

We will work through the [Day 3 lesson](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day3/Day3_1.html) together. We'll review our initial plotting skills from last week's session, explore new ways to manipulate our data as we plot, and learn how to customize our plotting outputs.


### Community Information

Here, we will provide information about the members of the learning community, so you can get to know your colleagues.
