## Welcome to the REAL R Short Course!

This is the course page for the Summer 2021 iteration of the REAL R Short Course.  Here, we will share all of the course materials and information in a central location.

### Course Schedule

We will meet synchronously via Zoom on Wednesdays from July 21 through September 8 (for a total of 8 sessions).

Eastern time: 1PM - 2PM

Central time: 12 noon - 1PM

Mountain time: 11AM - 12 noon

Pacific time: 10AM - 11AM

### Day One (July 21, 2021)

First, we will work on [Getting Started](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_GitHub.html), and will walk through computer set-up preliminaries.

Second, we will work through [R, RStudio, and RMarkdown](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_Activity.html), where we'll take our first foray into R.

Together, these two parts will serve as a starting point and foundation for the rest of our work together, and will set us up for discussions of graphing in Days 2 and 3!

### Between Day One and Day Two

Here is the Github location of the [Day 2 Prep Work](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/c81c92a0ee073a3e064e666c572b8fdaa8702c7a/Day2PrepWork/Day2PrepWork.Rmd) - the file you need is named Day2PrepWork.Rmd - this is an RMarkdown document. If you are using Github Desktop and have cloned the class repository (REALshortcourse_Summer2021), you should be able to find this within the new Day2PrepWork folder.  You'll want to open this file in RStudio, and then edit/run code within the document itself.  The document provides the instructions needed as you go.  Have fun, and don't hesitate to reach out if you are running into difficulties! 

### Day Two (July 28, 2021)

Major topic - plotting in R

We will work through the [Day 2 lesson](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day2/Day2_1.html) together - which will cover the importing of data from external files, all the way through using ggplot2 to build scatterplots and barplots.

It is unlikely that we'll get to the [Day 2 activity](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day2/Day2_2activity.html) during our synchronous time, but it is here for your reference even if we don't!

### Between Day Two and Day Three

Here is the Github location of the [Day 2 homework](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/30341e9b9741ad29486029c34a04d47c13a2cbb0/Day2Homework/Day2_hw.Rmd) - the ["Day2Homework"](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/tree/main/Day2Homework) folder contains both this RMarkdown file as well as the .csv file with the necessary data.  Happy plotting!

### Day Three (August 4, 2021)

Major topic - plotting in R, continued

We will work through the [Day 3 lesson](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day3/Day3_1.html) together. We'll review our initial plotting skills from last week's session, explore new ways to manipulate our data as we plot, and learn how to customize our plotting outputs.

### Between Day Three and Day Four

Here is the Github location of the [Day 3 homework / Day 4 prep work](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/tree/main/Day3homeworkandDay4prepwork) - with both a RMarkdown file and a .csv data source.  Good luck!

### Day Four (August 11, 2021)

Major topic - data manipulation using dplyr

We will work through the [dplyr_part_1](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/main/Day4/dplyr_part_1.Rmd) activity as a group.

### Between Day Four and Day Five

In the [Day 4 folder](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/tree/main/Day4) in Github, there is an activity titled dplyr_superhero - you may not be able to fully complete it without the material planned for Day 5, but feel free to get started on the questions relating to what you learned in Day 4!

In addition, we are hoping to hear from you about what is working well and not as well for you as members of the learning community - please complete [this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBilOUML-qRPT1-crWuqIdRE-Bt8A-FPBO0oXTMVUoQLPl9g/viewform?usp=sf_link) when you have a chance! 

### Day Five (August 18)

Major topic - data manipulation using dplyr, continued

We will work through the [dplyr_part_2](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/main/Day4/dplyr_part_2.Rmd) activity as a group.  (Note that this activity is found in the Day 4 folder!)

### Between Day Five and Day Six

In the [Day 4 folder](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/tree/main/Day4) in Github, there is an activity titled dplyr_superhero - you should now be equipped to tackle this activity!

### Day Six (August 25)

Major topic - data transformation using mutate() and summarize()

We will work through the [mutate_summarize](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day6/mutate_summarize.html) activity as a group - [.rmd file here](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/main/Day6/mutate_summarize.Rmd).

### Community Information

Here, we will provide information about the members of the learning community, so you can get to know your colleagues.
